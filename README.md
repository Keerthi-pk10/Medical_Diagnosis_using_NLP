The project “ Medical Diagnosis using Natural Language 
Processing ” aims to design a medical diagnosis system which will detect the 
disease based on the patients’ symptoms and suggest the right healthcare 
professional to consult. The corpus used is formed from trusted textbooks used in 
the medical field. Natural Language Processing is used to extract and pre-process 
data from these textbooks.
